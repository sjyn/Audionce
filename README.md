# Audionce
The android Audionce app

Audionce is a simple idea: you drop sounds in a place, and others can hear it. The hope is that it will add to the background of cities and other areas where people live. Personally, I think it's a pretty bomb idea.

This app is the brain child of <a href="https://github.com/iciaio">Alicia Iott</a>. The idea is powered by her; the android version of the app is powered by me.<br/>
Currently, the oAuth key for the Parse initialization and the Google Maps v2 API are available, but when a release is posted, these will be removed from the code.

#Goals
Currently, the code is full of TODO comments. While my main focus is the Android version of this app, I like to pop over and (attempt to) mess with the iOS version of the app as well. As such, some of the TODOs will be addressed, and others will not.<br/>

To be honest, I'm terrible at UI design, and Alicia is pretty much holding my hand through it. I like to deal with things like more efficient code, cloud code, storing data, database management, and things like that. But I guess I do eventually have to maybe probably do all that UI stuff. Woo.
