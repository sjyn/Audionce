# Audionce
The android Audionce app

Audionce is a simple idea: you drop sounds in a place, and others can hear it. The hope is that it will add to the background of cities and other areas where people live. Personally, I think it's a pretty bomb idea.

This app is the brain child of <a href="https://github.com/iciaio">Alicia Iott</a>. The idea is powered by her; the android version of the app is powered by me.<br/>
Currently, the oAuth key for the Parse initialization and the Google Maps v2 API are available, but when a release is posted, these will be removed from the code.

#Goals
Exciting news! Audionce is ready for release. It still has bugs, but it is good enough to put up on the app store. Once I get the correct keys from Parse and Google Maps, I'll put it up on the app store.<br/>
If you're interested in testing the app, just email me and I can send you the .apk.
