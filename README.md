# Audionce
The android Audionce app

This app is the brain child of <a href="https://github.com/iciaio">Alicia Iott</a>. The idea is powered by her; the android version of the app is powered by me.<br/>
Currently, the oAuth key for the Parse initialization and the Google Maps v2 API are available, but when a release is posted, these will be removed from the code.
